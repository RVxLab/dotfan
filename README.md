## Building From Source

Building from source requires the following installed:

- PHP 8.4
- Composer
- [ext-sodium](https://www.php.net/manual/en/sodium.installation.php) (pre-installed by default)

Pull in all the dependencies, then run the build script:

```shell
composer install
composer build:all
```

If you wish to run each step separately, run the following:

```shell
composer run build:clean
composer run build:phar
composer run build:static
```

Builds will be available in the `./builds` directory.
